                The full process involved RIE/wet etching, ALD for dielectric layers, and rigorous AFM/SEM metrology.⌟

                <p>
                &emsp;In a semiconductor quantum dot device, the precise manipulation of individual electrons is achieved 
                by applying voltages to metallic nanogates, forming potential landscapes that confine particles and define 
                the energy levels of a qubit. To meet the exacting nanometer-scale dimensions required, the utilization of 
                <b>electron-beam (E-beam) lithography</b> becomes imperative for patterning these critical features.
                <br><br>
                 &emsp;My work involved the complete, end-to-end fabrication of multi-layered silicon quantum dot devices,
                 starting from a bare Si/SiGe quantum well wafer. The process began with defining the active device area via 
                 <b>mesa etching</b>, where I gained experience with both dry (Reactive Ion Etching) and wet (chemical) 
                 etching techniques. This was followed by defining ohmic contacts through <b>phosphorus ion implantation and 
                 rapid thermal annealing (RTA)</b>. 
                 A critical challenge in silicon is preventing the formation of spurious quantum dots between gates. To address this, we employed an <b>overlaid gate structure</b>, which demands exceptional alignment between multiple layers. To achieve this, I implemented a comprehensive alignment strategy using a full set of P, Q, R, and S markers for maximum precision.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;The core of the fabrication relied on a <b>hybrid lithography approach</b>: 
                I used a maskless photolithography system for large-scale patterns like pads and markers, 
                and an E-beam lithography system for the fine, nanometer-scale gates. 
                A practical challenge I solved during E-beam writing was the blurring of patterns due to the significant 
                topography of the pre-etched alignment markers (2-3 µm deep). 
                To overcome this, I developed a protocol involving <b>manual focus and stigmation adjustments</b> for each marker, 
                ensuring sharp and accurately placed nanogates. 
                The multi-layered gate stack was built up through successive steps of E-beam lithography, 
                metal deposition via E-beam evaporation, and liftoff, 
                with each gate layer isolated by a thin film of Al₂O₃ deposited via <b>Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)</b>. 
                Intermediate cleaning steps, such as using <b>O₂ plasma ashing</b> to remove photoresist residue, 
                were employed to maintain device quality.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;Throughout the entire process, rigorous characterization and calibration were performed using tools such as 
                <b>Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM)</b> to verify critical dimensions, 
                etch depths, and alignment accuracy. This systematic and detail-oriented approach to fabrication was essential 
                for producing the high-quality, reliable quantum devices used in my subsequent measurement experiments.
