The orange circle marks the location of the quantum dot, and the crossed boxes indicate ohmic contacts. The cobalt micromagnet is enclosed by the red dotted lines, whose
                              field direction is qualitatively plotted by the red transparent arrow. The magnetic field
                              is applied in-plane to the 2DEG, as depicted in the upper left corner. 
                        <b>(b)</b> The charge stability diagram near (1,1) and (2,0) regimes. The location of the EST (PSB) regime is marked by the green box (blue triangle).
                        <b>(c)</b> The Rabi oscillation, which is plotted after a series of Rabi pulse applications whose parking position was at either EST (green)
                              or PSB (blue). When parked at EST, the oscillation frequency increased with the lab time, indicating that the serial Rabi pulse application increased ∆Bz. On the contrary,
                              the parking at PSB showed the exact opposite behavior. 
                        <b>(d)</b> The change of the Rabi oscillation frequency as a function of lab time. The PSB- and EST-parking scheme shows the opposite behavior.

                        The bottom trace clearly shows a "beating" pattern, 
                        which is a signature of coherent coupling to a neighboring quantum dot spin states.

              ⌜Developed <b>comprehensive simulation frameworks</b> to model complex quantum phenomena in semiconductor qubits. Created a <b>full, end-to-end simulation package</b> that computes electron wavefunctions from CAD layouts by solving the Schrödinger equation, and convolves them with <b>MuMax3-simulated</b> magnetic fields.

              <p>
                  &emsp;To complement my experimental work, I have developed a strong expertise in computational modeling to understand the complex physics governing quantum dot systems. 
                  My initial work focused on explaining the bidirectional <b>dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)</b> observed in GaAs singlet-triplet qubits. 
                  By modeling the system with a modified Hubbard model that incorporated excited-level spin mixing, my simulation successfully reproduced the experimental DNP behavior, providing a theoretical explanation for this previously unexplained phenomenon. 
                  The details can be found in my <u><a href="https://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/181098/1/000000169288.pdf" target="_blank">Master's thesis</a></u>.
                  <br><br>
                  &emsp;Building on this experience, I later used the <b>QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python)</b> framework to investigate the coherent interaction between a singlet-triplet qubit and a neighboring multi-electron quantum dot in a <sup>28</sup>Si/SiGe device. 
                  To explain the characteristic beating and dephasing observed in Ramsey measurements (as seen in Figs. 2c and 3c of our <u><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-024-00869-y" target="_blank">npj Quantum Information</a></u> publication), 
                  I solved the <b>quantum master equation</b> for the coupled system, introducing a phenomenological <b>Lindbladian for dephasing</b>. 
                  These computationally intensive simulations were accelerated by leveraging Python's <b>multiprocessing</b> capabilities to parallelize the calculations.
                  <br><br>
                  &emsp;Most recently, to investigate an anomalously long coherence time observed in a silicon device, I developed a <b>full, end-to-end simulation package</b> that connects device geometry to quantum mechanical properties.
                  This package features a pipeline that: (1) Parses device layouts from <b>CAD files</b> using a custom Python tool, (2) Calculates the 2D electrostatic potential landscape, (3) Solves the 2D <b>Schrödinger equation using a Finite Difference Method</b> to obtain the electron wavefunction, (4) Simulates the micromagnet's 3D stray field using <b>MuMax3</b>, and finally, (5) Convolves the wavefunction with the stray field to compute the effective magnetic field experienced by the qubit. 
                   To accelerate this computationally intensive step, the core calculation was implemented in C++ utilizing multithreading, which achieved a nearly <b>100x speedup</b> compared to a pure Python implementation. This high-performance C++ backend was then seamlessly integrated into the Python workflow using Pybind11. 
                  This tool, some of which can be found at this <u><a href="https://github.com/jonginnyun/qsimjy" target="_blank">link</a></u>, enables rapid design validation and a deeper understanding of the physics underlying our experimental results.
